===Some book keeping stuff===
1)Check if hostname run

	hostname
	hostname -f
2)Update your system:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

===Installing MySQL===

1)Install MySQL

	** You can use homebrew on OSX if you have it **
	brew install mysql
	************************************************
2)Harden Server <OPTIONAL BUT SUGGESTED> 
	sudo mysql_secure_installation
3)Login as root	
	mysql -u root -p
4)Create the tables
	mysql -u root -p <  createtable.sql;

===Installing Apache===
	sudo apt-get install apache2

==Run the Java==
1) Compile
	javac [java file]
2) Run w/ class paths.
	java -classpath .:[.../mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar Directory] JDBC

== Compiling Tomcat Files ==
	One thing to note was that the files that where written as .java files need to be compiled every single time as a consequence of being java files. The class will not change unless recompiled with javac and reloaded. While this problem existed for the java files, the jsp files did not have a problem like the servlets did. JSP is a webpage scripting language that can generate dynamic content while Servlets are Java programs that are already compiled which also creates dynamic web content.

	A very apt desription is that a servlet is html in java while a jsp is java in html. So while the server will compile the JSP everytime without reloading, it does suffer a speed penalty by being compiled everytime.

	While the majority of this project was written and compiled in Eclipse, one may choose to also compile the program in javac.

	

	You would compile with something like:

	javac -d "/usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/8.0.33/libexec/webapps/TomcatForm/WEB-INF/classes" -classpath "/usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/8.0.33/libexec/webapps/TomcatForm/WEB-INF/sources/.:/usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/8.0.33/libexec/webapps/TomcatForm/WEB-INF/lib/servlet-api.jar:/usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/8.0.33/libexec/webapps/TomcatForm/WEB-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar" /usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/8.0.33/libexec/webapps/TomcatForm/WEB-INF/sources/LoginForm.java

	if you wished to compile LoginForm.java; you would have to do this for all the files.
