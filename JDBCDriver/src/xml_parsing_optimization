Some methods of performance tuning that are possible to speed up the insert is to do:
- Batch Inserts
- Removed Triggers
- Compile and run with the terminal

Batch Triggers-
	With Batch Triggers the database can know that it is taking iin a lot of the same type of insert. This will shave time as mentioned in class we will not have to go through too many other layers. Also doing one large insert vs many small ones gave a lot of speed as well since we have even less overhead.
Removed Triggers-
	Earlier in this project there was triggers to deal with adding things to tables. While these worked, they were slow so replaced with faster methods to populate the members in the tables. 
Compile and run with the terminal-
	This speeds up the proccess oddly as well
